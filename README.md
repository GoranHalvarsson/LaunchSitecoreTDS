Launch Sitecore is a site found at [www.launchsitecore.net](www.launchsitecore.net). It is a great, shared source site that shows the power of Sitecore through Page Editor and DMS. The site comes complete with content, components, engagement plans and much more. A Sitecore package for the complete site can be downloaded from the above link after registering.

This repository is that package converted to a Visual Studio solution with items in Team Development for Sitecore. It's intended to serve as a platform for helping developers understand TDS, Glass Mapper, and Code Generation with TDS. It also allows developers to quickly setup a site with content, so that other additional features can be tested on a complete site.
