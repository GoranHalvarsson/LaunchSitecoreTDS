<p>With the guiding principles in mind, Launch Sitecore was built to be an example reference implementation as a starting point. As implementers become more proficient in Sitecore, it is expected that this site can be used as a launching point to try more advanced development techniques or implementation strategies - thus the reason why it was named Launch Sitecore. </p>
<p>Lastly, another goal is to provide as much insight as possible in how and why things were implemented the way they were. The following is a description on how we set up our development process: </p>
<p><strong>Development Setup</strong> - From the beginning, Launch Sitecore was built using a distributed team structure. A dedicated development/authoring server was used for all team members to check in code and to edit content while each developer workstation had their own instance of the solution. We used Subversion to be our source control tool of choice. The development team used Hedgehog's Team Development for Sitecore (TDS) add-in for Visual Studio which allowed the project to source control Sitecore content items and also to automate the deployment process. Lastly, every developer used Sitecore Rocks which is a Visual Studio 2010 plug-in that gives the developer the ability to interact with the Sitecore content items from within Visual Studio. </p>
<p>In summary, a typical developer workstation for this implementation would have the following software installed:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Windows 7 64-bit Laptop</li>
 <li>.NET Framework 2.0/3.5/4.0</li>
 <li>IIS 7.5</li>
 <li>SQL Server 2008 (Express version also supported)</li>
 <li>Visual Studio 2010 with Sitecore Rocks</li>
 <li>Hedgehog Development Team Development for Sitecore</li>
 <li>Subversion Client</li>
 <li>Sitecore 6.5 installed</li>
</ul>
