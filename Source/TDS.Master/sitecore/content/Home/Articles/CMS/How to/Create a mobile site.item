<p>While Mobile Development is a very broad and very important topic these days, this article will introduce a few concepts that will help you create a mobile strategy for the Sitecore platform.</p>

<p>Mobile site development is certainly a significant topic, and this article is by no means an attempt at an exhaustive discussion of the strategies and implementations involved. I'd suggest also taking a look at an <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/Community/Best-Practice-Blogs/Topics/Mobile-Web.aspx" target="_blank">area of the Sitecore site</a> where our implementation partners discuss this topic.</p>
<p> <br />
There are two areas that I will focus on for this article: the Device concept in Sitecore, and Sitecore's upcoming Mobile SDK / Web API. I'll touch on some of the information architecture topics involved in mobile site development, but this involves a strategy based on your specific requirements and should be carefully considered both internally and also potentially with a Sitecore implementation partner. </p>
<p>Sitecore promotes the reuse of content in many different ways from the ability to create multiple versions of content items in multiple languages, to Cloning, to centralized, referenced items to the Device concept. You are really able to model your content in any flexible way that serves your particular requirements and needs. This can span the range of completely segregated content branches dedicated to the "browser" based site and mobile site, to a single content branch serving both purposes, to a mixture of the two strategies. I would suggest that most real world scenarios involve this mixture and take advantage of both the reusability of content in Sitecore but also account for the significant differences that warrant segregated content.</p>
<p> <br />
The Device concept in Sitecore introduces one powerful reuse capability for content items. A Device in Sitecore is really just a logical construct, modeled as a Sitecore content item, with fields that allow you to define its attributes. Below shows the Print device highlighted, with the fields that make up the items of type Device (based on the /sitecore/templates/System/Layout/Device Data Template). </p>
<p><img alt="" width="505" height="428" src="~/media/07CA312148104491988717BD8ED559EC.ashx" /></p>
<p>A few things to note here. If you right click on the Devices item, you'll see the ability to insert a new Device. This just follows the typical Insert Options strategy. So, a Device is just a standard Sitecore item with fields that allow you to easily hook into Sitecore's device resolution processing as it evaluates the HTTP request. With the default Device items, this ability is pretty simple (and therefore a bit restrictive): you are able to populate either the Browser agent or Query string fields, looking for matches in each respectively. You are also able to define whether this is the "Default" device (meaning that nothing about the request matched any specific criteria defined in your device items, so Sitecore resorts to using this defined Default device). A very nice Shared Source offering brings in the power of Sitecore's Rules Engine: <a href="http://trac.sitecore.net/MobileDeviceDetector">http://trac.sitecore.net/MobileDeviceDetector</a>.</p>
<p>The Mobile Device Detector adds a field to the Device data template (a "Conditions" field of type "Rules") that allows you to invoke the Rule Set Editor and match many additional conditions based on attributes of the user agent making the request. This module does a look up the WURFL database to determine many additional capabilities of the requestor: </p>
<p><img alt="" width="309" height="136" src="~/media/04F467EDC3294ACCBB1EF8FDD046B2D4.ashx" /></p>
<div></div>
<p>With your Devices defined, you are now able to specifically strategize the presentation components that Sitecore should use when responding to a request from that Device. You have many options, including:</p>
<div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Using a completely different Layout (.aspx)</li>
  <li>Having a header control or code within the .aspx that makes style choices based on the Device resolved</li>
  <li>Use a different (potentially overlapping) set of controls on the page</li>
  <li>Build in Device specific logic into the same set of controls used on each Device </li>
</ul>
<p>As a best practice, you are setting up the Presentation details for your content on the Standard Values of the Data Template that defines your content types. The example below is from the Nicam sales demonstration site, where Presentation details have been set up for various devices for the News Article Data Template. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="516" height="667" src="~/media/D2B7F1BC4C1B48058B688940FFD0D320.ashx" /></p>
<p>Note that, in this strategy, each Device uses a different .aspx (Nicam, Nicam Print, Feed Delivery Layout). Each Device also has a different set of controls used to respond. Mobile Devices are easily added to this list. Scrolling down in the Presentation Details window shows: </p>
<p><img alt="" width="516" height="667" src="~/media/B9CC77FC9D394E10BA7B78644A1C806F.ashx" /></p>
<p>While only the IPhone Presentation Details have been decided on (using the Alternate Device Layout), you'll notice that we could go ahead and add details for the Device defined as "Mobile phone" (maybe a more generic Mobile response). With the WURFL attributes in hand, we can also make specific decisions based on the mobile device's capability (cookies, Flash, Javascript, screen resolution, etc.). <br />
Below is a screen shot of how the Nicam site responds to an iPhone request: </p>
<p><img alt="" width="386" height="742" style="width: 294px; height: 592px;" src="~/media/71F3BAF83A53455D8A422A5AC622D223.ashx" /></p>
<p>We know now that, by defining an iPhone Device, this gave us the capability to identify that it was an iPhone making a request to Sitecore, specifically during the HttpRequestBegin pipeline, using this processor: </p>
<div class="code">
<p>&lt;processor type="Sitecore.Pipelines.HttpRequest.DeviceResolver, Sitecore.Kernel"/&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>With the Device resolved, Sitecore is able to use the specific presentation details (Layout, controls) that you've identified should be used for this response. <br />
One additional thing to note about this Nicam example. The navigation that is used here (News, Products, Articles) is defined as its own set of content items. This is a good example of reusing content, but making specific decisions that differ for a mobile site. While the "Browser" site has a more extensive navigation system that follows the entire information architecture of the site, the Mobile site becomes more focused on specific areas of content (while not necessarily duplicating that content to do so). A navigation control on the Mobile site's presentation details looks to this area of the content tree to define its navigation: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="" width="221" height="99" src="~/media/51DA1F8E3F1D452CAA796AAA8C0A77FA.ashx" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The items below these sections could be clones of the browser site items, they could be their own independent items, or they could be "pointer" items (items that sit as children of these items with a droplink field pointing to the original item). In this way, you can completely decide on the level of flexibility these items need vs. the consolidated maintenance benefits of single sourced items. <br />
The last section of this article will be added to significantly in the near future (or broken out to its own article). A very exciting project is in the works at Sitecore where a new Mobile SDK and Web API are being introduced. Sitecore has always had an incredible API for developers to take advantage of Sitecore content from outside the application. There has also always been a SOAP-based set of Web Service methods. Take a look at your own Sitecore installation at:</p>
<p> <br />
http://[Your Site]/sitecore/shell/WebService/Service.asmx </p>
<p>With the introduction of these new projects, Sitecore is introducing a RESTful API, JSON packaging of Sitecore content, and a set of iOS-specific features to aid in your mobile app development. These features are expected in June 2012, so much more to come soon! </p>
