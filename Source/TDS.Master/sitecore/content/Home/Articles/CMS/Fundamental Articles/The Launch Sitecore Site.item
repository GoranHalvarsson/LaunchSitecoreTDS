<p>Welcome to the Launch Sitecore site. It is designed to help you evaluate Sitecore and understand the key concepts about the Sitecore architecture.</p>
<p>Sitecore is a platform to deliver business-specific content management solutions. More like a box of content management building blocks than an out-of-the-box solution, Sitecore enables customers to implement solutions that meet their needs without compromise.</p>
<p>Launch Sitecore is a site to help understand what those building blocks are and how to use them. It can also be used as an accelerator for proof of concepts or as a test bed for add on modules.</p>
<p>Topics such as knowing how to create a simple site from scratch, to setting up your development environment to learning more about the architectural concepts are all included in this site.</p>
